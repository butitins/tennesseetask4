Hi John,  

Thanks for reaching out and for your enthusiasm about joining the Advanced track! We can see how passionate and driven you are, and it’s amazing to hear about your background.  

Our placement process is designed to ensure every student has the best experience possible, so we base track assignments solely on technical interview skills assessed during the pre-work. This way, everyone is set up for success at the right level.  

The Intermediate track will still be challenging and rewarding, with topics overlapping at the start. If you’re eager to go beyond the curriculum, we’re happy to share advanced resources you can explore alongside the course.  

Let us know if you’d like those resources or if you have any other questions. We’re here to support you throughout the program!  

Best regards,  
Tennessee  
CodePath Admissions Team
