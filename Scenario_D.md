Hi Dennis,  

Thanks for reaching out. We understand how important this course is to you, and we truly appreciate your willingness to make things right.  

Unfortunately, the policy on coursework completion is in place to ensure all students stay on track and get the most out of the program. Since you missed the deadline and didn’t respond earlier, we’re unable to reinstate you into the course.  

That said, you still have **lifetime access** to the course material through your GitHub account. We encourage you to continue learning at your own pace, and if you’d like, we can provide additional guidance on how to make the most of the materials.  

Let us know if there’s anything else we can do to help you stay on your learning journey!  

Best regards,  
Tennessee  
CodePath Admissions Team
