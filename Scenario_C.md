Hi Anne,  

Thanks so much for reaching out and for your interest in our Summer Interview Prep course. I’m so sorry to hear about your situation—we know how competitive internships can be, and it’s clear you’re putting in so much effort.  

Unfortunately, the deadline for this year’s course has passed, and the class is already full. We truly wish we could accommodate everyone, but space is very limited.  

To help you with your interview prep, we’d love to share our [guide](http://bit.ly/41AsIOn), which includes tips and guidelines many students have found helpful. You can also explore additional resources on our website and sign up for our mailing list to stay informed about future programs or events that might benefit you.  

We’re rooting for your success and hope you find these tools helpful as you move forward!  

Warm regards,  
Tennessee
