Hi Jane,  

Thank you so much for reaching out and for the effort you put into building your app—it’s clear you’re incredibly dedicated. We’re really sorry to hear about your disappointment, and we completely understand how frustrating this must feel.  

While we’d love to include everyone, our current courses are limited to students enrolled in partner universities in the US due to the sponsorships that make these programs possible. However, we’re constantly working on expanding to other regions.  

We’d love to keep you updated! If you join our mailing list, we’ll notify you about future opportunities, including any international programs we launch. In the meantime, we can share some learning resources to help you continue your journey independently.  

Please don’t hesitate to let us know if you’d like access to those resources or if there’s anything else we can assist with.  

Wishing you the very best,  
Tennessee
